Rubella heatmap library
=======================

Rubella is a library to generate heatmaps to monitor visualize measured values
easier. Like the load of multiple CPU cores over time.

Therefore every CPU core gets its own JSON array over the measured time. So the
array gets it's own row in the headmap. The more the color itensity the higher
is the load.
(The values are in percent. So they must be beween 0 and 100.)

During the time you can see, if an unusual behavior occurs, because the image
shows a different load distribution.
