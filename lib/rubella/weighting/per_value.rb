    # Gets an input object and prepares the data for the output.
    #
    # This class weights the input data per value.
    # Which means, that all values together make 100%. So you need all values at
    # the same level, to get the maximum color intensity.
    #
    # The output is an Array which contains again an Array per every point of
    # time, which contains the load in the given steps (default is 10% per step)
    # and the value in percentage for the representative olor intensity.
